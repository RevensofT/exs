# EXS - Extend Standard Library

## What's this using for ?
It's a library for do something .net core can do but those feature has been block by language rule, like pointer for Vb.net or tail call recursion in C#.

It also include some quality of life feature like pre build recursion function and fraction format (it's much better for me to keep it in fraction format instead float number.)

### Why so many method hasn't comment or summary?
Just some rush reason to stick my code to GitHub Arctic Code Vault, also I think many of method name is explain themself enough.
